# Typwriter Effect in Python ‚å®
Does your text ever look so boring in the console? Well, forget plain old text and try out the Typewriter function! Add a little spice to your console by using this easy-to-read Python file.

# How to Use ‚Ñπ
- Download this repository or head to the [`releases page`](https://github.com/SpyderGamer/Typewriter-Effect-in-Python/releases)!
- You can make your main project inside the `TypewriterEffect.py` file (Not recommended).
- Or import it to a seperate Python file (Useful if you already have existing project). Add this to the top of your code: `from TypewriterEffect import *`. And to ever use the functions just call it:  `typewriter("String")`, works just like the `print()` function! Check `Main.py` for an example.
